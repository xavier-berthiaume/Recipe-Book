# Recipe Store

A modern and lightweight FOSS application that lets you store and organize your recipes. You can share recipes if you'd like to, but that's completely optional, I don't want to hear about your shitty recipes you're too afraid to share anyways.

## Documentation

See [`/docs/REAMDE.md`](./docs/README.md) for more info.
