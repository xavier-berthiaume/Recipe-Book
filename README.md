# Recipe-Book

This is my third and final implementation of this application built to keep track of recipes. My goal is to have a well implemented and user friendly application, built to be easily maintainable and extensible.

The application is written in C++ built using the Qt framework. Although there is an abstraction layer for the database, leaving space for many different database implementations, I plan on writing an Sqlite3 implementation and no others.

When planning and writing the application, I will be following the architecture principles of Model-View-Controller, using the built-in solutions of the Qt framework (Views-Models-Delegates).
