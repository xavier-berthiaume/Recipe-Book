# Source Code

The source code for the project is organized along 3 principle functions:

- The classes that represent recipes, ingredients, and more tangible information that's relevant to making the software work
- The classes tied to UI elements, either extending functionality or defining new functionality altogether
- The classes tied to database use and access


## Directory structure

```/models``` Contains all models representing tangible data
```/ui``` Contains all classes related to ui elements
```/db``` Contains manager classes for database elements
